# STATE.md — current operational control record

`STATE.md` holds only active custody and retryable operational intent. Git is
the authority for landed history; GitHub Project #4 is a mirror, never evidence.

## CURRENT

| id | kind | status | owner | custody | updated | source | github_item | mirror_state | summary |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| STATE-20260904-006 | hazard | open | human owner | main agent | 2026-09-04 | owner directive 2026-09-04 (keep a list of all gaps found and add them to STATE) | PVTI_lAHOAZFnCc4Bhhjqzg5chi0 | synced | GAPS LEDGER (consolidated, every gap found this session, owner directive to keep and grow this list): (1) REMOTE CI WATCH-GAP fixed by nullglob step rewrite in a41c5cf, ship.sh post-push monitor verified live. (2) COVERAGE FLOOR DRIFT restored to 95.34 in 9d4308d, local tier runs the same cov-fail-under 95. (3) TIER-GATE AUTHORITY GREP LEAK fixed with grep -q. (4) LEDGER_COMMIT GATE-3 BLINDNESS fixed by accepting archive markers. (5) TEMPLATE CLI DRIFT fixed in 08e2c19. (6) NOTHING-EVER-CLOSES PATHOLOGY fixed structurally by the batch ledger law. (7) STATE NUMBERING GAPS recorded (0902 missing 004 never minted, 012 and 016 closed-then-referenced). (8) EVENTS FORK documented on -003 close. (9) COLDPROBE FIRING BRANCH AMBIGUITY - OPEN, owner ruling required: D23 pins the probe to the sklearn tip but the remote sklearn branch no longer exists (renamed taxi) and the frozen taxi snapshot is perma-red (parity gate pins origin/sklearn, run 33808377555) - candidate firing line euromonitor. (10) DEADCODE CENSUS backlog filed 2026-09-04 at scratch/backlog/deadcode-census-2026-09-04.md, advisory only, config-key rows verified false positives. (11) SHIP MONITOR TIMEOUT RACE FIXED 2026-09-04: monitor now emits a per-poll heartbeat line (still-running visible to the caller instead of silence) and the exhaustion message carries the run id plus the exact gh run view command to re-check. (12) STASH HYGIENE RESOLVED 2026-09-04: both sklearn-era stashes preserved three ways (patches at /home/opc/ONE/stash-archive/, full bundle sklearn_stashes.bundle, gc-proof tags stash-archive/sklearn-7dcb34f and stash-archive/sklearn-c4f120a) then dropped - stash list now empty. (13) PARITY F1B PIN recorded as acceptable (taxi is a frozen archive branch per the 50x ruling). |
| STATE-20260904-008 | checkpoint | open | main agent | main agent | 2026-09-04 | gaps ledger item 11 remediation | PVTI_lAHOAZFnCc4Bhhjqzg5dSS8 | synced | ship.sh post-push monitor hardening landed 2026-09-04: the Actions poll loop now emits a heartbeat line each poll (monitor poll N/20 run status) so a slow CI run is visible as still-running instead of silent death under an outer tool timeout, the exhaustion message now carries the run id plus the exact re-check command (gh run view id), and the jq query now returns the run id alongside status and conclusion. Motivation: run 33864307689 took 7m18s and the monitor invocation died at the tool timeout with no interim output. Verified via bash -n, shellcheck, and case-pattern unit tests for all five monitor shapes. |

## Access protocol

- Main alone uses `state_records.py record add|update|sync`; workers and
  reviewers only read and report.
- Local CURRENT intent is written before its mirror. A failed mirror leaves
  `mirror_state=pending`, and `record sync <id>` retries the same record.
- The helper changes only CURRENT; `## EVENTS` and the historical archive are
  immutable through this interface.

## Retention

The pre-foundation record is preserved verbatim in
`agents/ledger/archive/2026-08.md` from source commit `7dcb34f`. Current
operational history stays in git and Project #4 mirrors.

## EVENTS

Resolution registry for EVENT-line event-ids (third namespace — see the
citation rule in MAIN_AGENT_CONTRACT.md). A FULL-LINE `EVENT: issues/<n>#
issuecomment-<m> event-id <8hex>` line is valid iff a UNIQUE row exists here;
role vocabulary is no escape in this namespace, and duplicate event-id rows
are a probe violation. Superseded rows may outlive their EVENT lines.
Created_at values verified via gh api at pilot close; board-row created_at
values verified via api at seeding (store-then-hash). Provenance: the first
six rows are pilot backfills entered via owner gh-api writes (two genesis
events, D19-D21 backfills, custody-baseline); the five 2026-08-24T20:43Z
rows are CHANGE BOARD (#5) seeds R1-R5 posted this session. Each row's
`type` keeps its per-event ruling class, one unique row per legacy
narrative id. One further class exists: reviewer-authority rows registering
HARNESS-ERA AGENT AUTHORITIES so the ratified TIER-GATE grammar can resolve
Reviewer:-trailer verdicts; such a row carries NO GitHub comment provenance
(out-of-band verification only, grandfathered per the agent-id namespace
disposition lean), and its id pins the canonical posted form: sha256
first-8 over the row line with the id cell itself blanked — byte form:
single-space cells (`| |`), no trailing newline; any other blanking
reproduces a DIFFERENT hash and must be re-pinned.
